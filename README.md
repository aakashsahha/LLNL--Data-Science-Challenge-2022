Task to solve an exciting problem in drug discovery for COVID-19

Molecular docking is a method in computational chemistry to find moleculeâ€™s pose (orientation) and conformation where the ligand and target receptor are bound to form a stable complex.The best pose is selected based on the scoring functions (binding free energy). Ligands are screened using their best score (lowest binding free energy).
